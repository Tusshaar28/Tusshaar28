# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tushar Sharma, a tech enthusiast diving deep into the exciting worlds of Machine Learning, Web Development, and Natural Language Processing. Hereâ€™s a glimpse into what Iâ€™m up to and what Iâ€™m passionate about:

## ðŸŒŸ What Iâ€™m Excited About

### **Machine Learning Magic**
Iâ€™m all about harnessing the power of ML to make data-driven decisions and predictions. From predicting house prices to diagnosing brain tumors, I love tackling complex problems with smart algorithms and deep learning models. My latest project, a brain tumor detection system, uses TensorFlow and CNNs to improve early diagnosisâ€”because who doesnâ€™t want to make a difference?

### **Web Development Wonders**
Creating dynamic, user-friendly web applications is a thrill! Iâ€™ve built everything from finance trackers to resume rankers using the MERN stack and Streamlit. I enjoy turning complex back-end logic into sleek, interactive front-ends, and Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to enhance user experiences.

### **NLP Adventures**
Natural Language Processing is where things get really interesting for me. Iâ€™ve worked on resume ranking systems that sift through job descriptions and CVs to find the perfect match. Itâ€™s like giving machines the ability to understand and process human languageâ€”super cool, right?

## ðŸš€ My Projects

- **Brain Tumor Detection and Recommendation**: A CNN model trained on thousands of images for faster tumor detection, combined with Streamlit for tailored treatment recommendations.
  
- **Resume Ranker**: An NLP-powered system that ranks resumes against job descriptions, improving hiring efficiency. Deployed it on Streamlit Cloud for easy access!

- **Finance Tracker**: A personal finance app built with ReactJS and MongoDB, featuring insightful data visualizations with ChartJS and robust security with JWT.

- **House Price Prediction**: Engineered a model to predict house prices using Linear and Lasso Regression. Collected data through web scraping and hit an 82% accuracy rate!

## ðŸ“š Things Iâ€™m Learning

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++, and more.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Streamlit, ReactJS.
- **Tech Stacks**: MERN, Machine Learning, Deep Learning.
- **Tools**: VS Code, PyCharm, MongoDB.
